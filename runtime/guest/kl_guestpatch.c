// Measured guest-image patches — the table, and the guard that makes it safe.
//
// Everything here exists because of one class of gate: a branch inside the
// guest that this host cannot answer from outside. The project's rule is to
// implement what the guest FORCES and to answer honestly; a patch is the
// admission that there is no question being asked of us at all — the decision
// is already made inside the binary, and the only way to observe what is behind
// it is to take the other edge.
//
// So the bar for a row here is high, and every row carries how it was MEASURED:
//
//   * the address is a guest vaddr in a named library, not an offset in a file;
//   * the `expect` word is the instruction that was disassembled there, which
//     doubles as a build fingerprint — a different APK almost never has the
//     same word at the same address, so a stale row is skipped and NAMED rather
//     than corrupting an image;
//   * a group is atomic: either every word matches and all are written, or none
//     are. Half of a two-instruction replacement is a crash, not a no-op.
//
// Knobs (DEBUG_ENV_VARS.md): `KL_GUEST_PATCH=0` turns all of this off, which is
// the A/B for every row; `KL_GUEST_PATCH_OFF=<name>[,<name>...]` turns off one.
//
// DEVICE: a klepton-ld dylib is signed, so its text cannot be written at run
// time — which is why the entry point takes a RESOLVER rather than a base
// pointer, so the same table can be applied offline. tools/klepton_ld.c does
// exactly that (see its `gp_at`), so a row here reaches the headset as well as
// the host, and there is no host/device divergence to remember.

// Both rows were reached the same way and the route is worth keeping, because
// nothing in this target has a symbol: the metadata is decrypted with
// tools/vrc_metadata.py, an `Il2CppCodeGenModule`'s methodPointers array turns
// a method's token RID into an address, and a v29 metadata-usage slot holds
// `(kind << 29) | (index << 1) | 1` in the FILE until it is initialised — so a
// string literal decodes back to the `adrp`+`ldr` that reads it, and from there
// to the method.

// (1) The "Under Construction" wall.
//
// `VRCFlowManager`'s ManageGameFlow coroutine does, in effect:
//
//     while (VRCUiManager.Instance == null) yield return null;   // 'waiting for UI Manager'
//     yield return this.<wall>();                                // <-- here
//
// and the wall coroutine it yields is:
//
//     while (VRCUiPopupManager.Instance == null) yield return null;
//     VRCUiPopupManager.Instance.<hide>(null);
//     VRCUiManager.Instance.ShowScreen("MenuContent/Screens/Authentication/UnderConstruction");
//     for (;;) yield return null;                                // never completes
//
// The last line is what makes this a wall rather than a screen: the outer
// coroutine is waiting on an inner one that never returns false, so the whole
// game flow stops there forever. It is also why the obvious patches do NOT
// work, and both were tried: aliasing the screen-path string literal to
// `.../LoginPrompt` shows a different screen and still never advances, and
// NOPing the one conditional branch that reaches the yield leaves the other
// predecessor — the paths converge, so in this build the wall is effectively
// unconditional.
//
// What works is to make the inner coroutine COMPLETE: `MoveNext` returns false
// on its first call, `yield return` finishes immediately, and the flow carries
// on to what was behind it. The screen is never shown, and nothing else in the
// coroutine has a side effect worth keeping.

// at its ShowScreen call and watching the process die on signal 5 — worth the
// extra run, because the two failed patches above look exactly like dead code.

// the wall: "Update Required — Current: 1862, Required: 1865".
//
// This one is a real check against a real answer — the required build number
// comes from VRChat's own API — and the honest fix is a newer APK: the tree
// here is three builds old. It is patched anyway because otherwise the target
// stops at a second dead screen and nothing downstream of it can be brought up

// (3) The "Going to Error World" transition.
//
// The trigger that brought this row up: the APK genuinely does not ship
// AudioPluginOculusSpatializer, so every
// world load raises DllNotFoundException, and the managed response is:
//
//     E/Unity: Exception: Going to Error World
//
// The route to the code, since nothing here has a symbol:
// tools/vrc_code.py --literals 'Going to Error World' finds
// StringLiteral[13074]; --uses-literal names its one real reader,
// VRCFlowManager::ÌÌÎÌÍÌÌÍÌÏÍÍÌÌÌÍÎÍÏÍÏÎÌ at 0x6944074 (196 bytes). That
// method IS the error-world action, not a branch near it: it builds a
// System.Exception with that message, hands it to the shared LogException
// helper at 0x68acbd0 (the VRC.Core.Logger user — this is what prints the
// E/Unity line above), then starts the coroutine stored in [this + 0x148]
// through the generic coroutine starter at 0x6940030, and returns the
// Coroutine to its caller, which yields on it. The starter has nine other
// callers and is innocent; the literal's only other reader, a <>c lambda at
// 0x6aed654, just string.Formats the message. So the whole transition is
// exactly this one small method.
//
// --callers shows all six call sites live in two coroutines' MoveNext and
// every one is a failure path ('Failed to load default world {0} times,
// going to error world', "Couldn't validate world {0}", and their untagged
// siblings): the method is never reached from a healthy flow, so making it
// a no-op disables ONLY the error-driven transition. What the host loses is
// the Error World itself — a fallback that exists to give the user somewhere
// to stand when the real world failed, which is precisely the thrash when
// the failure is this host's missing spatializer. The DllNotFoundException
// is still logged by Unity; only the reaction is skipped.
//
// The replacement mirrors the wall row above: return before the prologue,
// with x0 = null so the caller's `yield return <coroutine>` degenerates to
// the benign `yield return null` (verified in the caller at 0x69701c0: the
// returned pair is stored, never dereferenced, before MoveNext continues).
//
//   0x6944074  sub sp, sp, #0x30        -> mov x0, xzr  ; "no transition"
//   0x6944078  stp x30, x21, [sp, #0x10] -> ret

// (4) The stereo rendering mode, in libUnityOpenXR.so rather than in the
// managed image — the one row here that is about pixels.
//
// This build asks for a swapchain with `arraySize 2`, which is the Single Pass
// Instanced layout, and single-pass instanced on GLES is `GL_OVR_multiview2`.
// ANGLE's Metal backend has no multiview at all (nothing in
// src/libANGLE/renderer/metal mentions it), so we advertise none, libunity
// resolves no multiview entry point, and its fall-back attaches ONE array
// layer — layer 0 — and never re-attaches. The right eye is therefore never
// drawn: measured as tex 29 layer 0 at 3,493,465 lit and layer 1 at 0 lit, in
// every frame of every run, with no GL error anywhere.
//
// The mode is not a question asked of this host. Unity's OpenXR C# pushes it
// down once, from the serialized `OpenXRSettings.renderMode`, through
// `NativeConfig_SetRenderMode(int)` — which is the whole of the decision:
//
//   0x76e08  stp x19, x30, [sp, #-0x10]!
//   0x76e0c  mov w19, w0                 -> mov w19, #0     ; MultiPass
//   0x76e10  bl  <singleton>
//   0x76e14  cbz x0, +0x18
//   0x76e18  bl  <singleton>
//   0x76e1c  str w19, [x0, #0x70]        ; the field every consumer reads
//
// `MultiPass = 0, SinglePassInstanced = 1` is the package's own enum, and the
// binary agrees: the consumer at +0x55120 tests the field against exactly 0 and
// 1 and treats anything else as neither.
//
// MultiPass is the mode that needs no extension: two passes, one array slice
// each, the plain (non-stereo) shader variant that every build ships. It costs
// twice the draw calls, which is the honest price of a display without
// multiview. `KL_GUEST_PATCH_OFF=vrchat-multipass` restores the failing
// configuration exactly.
static const kl_gp_word k_vrc_multipass[] = {
    { 0x76e0c, 0x2a0003f3, 0x52800013, "mov w19, w0 -> mov w19, #0  (MultiPass)" },
};


// (5) Unity's cross-context guard on every framebuffer bind.
//
// Framebuffer objects are container objects and are NOT shared between GL
// contexts, so Unity records the EGLContext each binding was made under and
// re-checks it before every bind. On a mismatch it binds `(GLuint)-1` rather
// than a name it believes is invalid here. The idiom is inlined at 35 sites,
// always the same three instructions, always calling GL table slot 1240:
//
//     cmp   x8, x20                 ; recorded context vs the live one
//     ccmp  wN, #0, #4, ne          ; ...or the name is 0
//     csinv w1, wN, wzr, eq         ; mismatch -> ~0
//
// `(GLuint)-1` is not a sentinel ANGLE invents and not a refused bind: the
// guest passes it, ANGLE accepts it, and the result is a framebuffer with no
// attachments — so the clear and every draw of that pass raise
// GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION and go nowhere. Measured on VRChat: 322 such
// errors in a 1500-frame run, 0 with this row applied.
//
// Neutralising the guard is truthful about what this runtime implements, and
// that is the whole justification: kl_glfb's default migration mode backs EVERY
// guest EGLContext with ONE real ANGLE context (see kl_glfb_make_current), so
// the framebuffer really is valid whichever guest context is nominally current.
// The distinction Unity is guarding against does not exist here.
//
// Three things about this row that must not be forgotten:
//
//   * WHAT TRIGGERS THE MISMATCH IS NOT EXPLAINED. Every eglGetCurrentContext
//     in the run answers the same context, and every framebuffer is created
//     under it, so the recorded value must be captured somewhere this
//     instrumentation did not see. Beat Saber never binds -1 at all; AVPro's
//     third context was suspected and MEASURED INNOCENT (refusing it leaves two
//     contexts and the -1 binds remain).
//   * IT DOES NOT FIX THE WORLD LOAD. VRChat still fails to instantiate a
//     scene with this applied — that is a separate cause, and the adjacency of
//     the two in the log is a coincidence.
//   * On device it is applied OFFLINE by tools/klepton_ld.c, like every row
//     here, so the host and the headset agree.

// (6) The AudioPluginOculusSpatializer per-frame exception storm.
//
// The Steam Frame APK ships the Oculus spatializer's MANAGED code but not its
// native module, so every P/Invoke into it throws DllNotFoundException — on
// real hardware too, not just here. Measured: ~1 throw per frame, every frame
// (587-609 in 600-frame headless runs), and each one costs a full IL2CPP
// exception raise (our dlopen miss is cached; the throw is not). The call
// site evaded four static hunts because the
// module name lives only in P/Invoke metadata and the resolver is reached
// indirectly.
//
// The route that worked: `vrc_code.py --type '^OculusSpatializerUnity$'`
// lists the component's 27 methods; the small ones (124-136 bytes, no
// metadata usages) are IL2CPP's P/Invoke thunks, and each embeds its
// resolver data in plain sight — an adrp+add pair naming the module string
// ('AudioPluginOculusSpatializer', 28 chars) and another naming the native
// entry point. Reading those strings out of the binary attributes every
// thunk: OSP_Unity_AssignRaycastCallback (two variants), SetDynamicRoom*,
// UpdateRoomModel, GetRoomDimensions, GetRaycastHits.
//
// The per-frame caller is OculusSpatializerUnity::Update (0x67a0c80). Its
// prologue reads a bool at [this+0x38]: if set it builds a delegate and
// calls the marshaling AssignRaycastCallback variant (0x679dab4) at
// 0x67a0d88; either way the paths merge at 0x67a0e50 and call the plain
// AssignRaycastCallback thunk (0x679f1e0) at 0x67a0e68, followed by the
// SetDynamicRoom* chain. The FIRST of these to run throws, and exactly one
// throw per frame says the exception unwinds clean out of Update — so on
// real hardware everything in Update after that call is dead code, every
// frame, forever.
//
// The patch therefore does by branch what hardware does by exception: at
// each of the two throwing call sites, jump to Update's own epilogue
// (0x67a13e8, the register-restore ladder ending in ret at 0x67a1414). No
// managed side effect is skipped that hardware would have performed — on
// hardware the throw unwinds past the same instructions. The spatializer's
// dynamic-room feature is off either way; what changes is only the cost and
// the log. One-time throws from Start (same thunks, other call sites) are
// left alone: they are once, not per frame.
//

//   0x67a0e68  bl 0x679f1e0  -> b 0x67a13e8   ; merged per-frame path
//

// epilogue at 0x67a13e8 begins `ldp x20, x19, [sp, #0xa0]` (0xa94a4ff4),

// Wrath2 (libUE4.so) — the "COMPILING SHADERS" title segment is left to the game.
//
// AAW_CompileShadersTitleScreenSegment gates on
// FShaderPipelineCache::NumPrecompilesRemaining() reaching 0. A patch here
// ("wrath2-pso-done": 0xcded830 -> mov w0, #0; ret) used to answer 0 for it,
// from the time the precompile stalled at ~529 PSOs and the segment never
// ended. The precompile drains now, a pipeline per guest frame, and all the
// patch still did was end the game's own screen after ten seconds: the eye
// picture stayed black for the minutes the rest of the pipelines took, with
// nothing saying why. Without it (headset, 2026-10-13) the screen stood for
// 3 min 50 s while the count went from 3,600 to 8,980, and the game went on to
// its calibration by itself. Should the precompile stall again, the segment
// stays up and the log's "pipeline warmup" count stops climbing.

// NOTE (hl2/libtogl.so multiview): TWO reverted experiments now.
// (1) Forcing the generate BIT on (0xa1788 `tbnz w23,#0` -> `b`) fired generation at
//     precache and poisoned the "already tried" latch (vshader[0x64]=1).
// (2) NOP the latch short-circuit at 0xa0878 so a poisoned shader retries — REVERTED.
//     Confirmed on-device the retry DOES happen (each "no usable variant" now logs
//     twice) but the generator (0xa0808) STILL returns 0 every time, AND it regressed
//     boot (never reached the black screen). So the failure is NOT the latch:
//     - the port IS requesting multiview variants at draw time (it logs "no usable
//       variant for lightmappedgeneric_vs20/skin_vs20/..."), so the generate bit is set;
//     - the marker `gl_Position = vTempPos;` IS present in the translated GLSL (dumped
//       in the log), and the 0xa0aac "unsupported vertex shader layout" warning does
//       NOT fire, so the generator passes the marker check;
//     - there is NO ANGLE compile error logged either.
//     => the generator fails DEEPER in its body (0xa0918+, past the marker), returning
//     0 for a reason not yet traced. That is the real thing to chase — read the full
//     generator body's return-0 paths. libtogl is per-title (portal's is a different
//     binary), so a future fix can be fingerprint-keyed to hl2 safely.

// hl2 multiview shader-gen: three patch experiments tried, all applied (mkguest.sh
// re-translates every build; --quiet just hides klepton-ld's "[patch] ... applied"),
// none fixed it: (1) 0xa1788 tbnz->b force; (2) 0xa0878 latch NOP; (3) 0xa1a48
// `ldr w3` -> `mov w3,#1`. With (3) the generator STILL never reaches glCompileShader
// (num_views/gl_ViewID_OVR count = 0 in the log) and no "compile failed"/"unsupported
// layout" warning fires — so the generator (0xa0808) returns 0 at a SILENT path
// (a082c [0x8]!=0, a0868 [0x18]==0, or a0890 [0x4c]==0), i.e. before it builds/compiles.
// Likely the world shaders route through the OTHER caller 0xa1eec (w3=w20, from the
// enclosing fn's w3 arg), which (3) did not force; or the shader object handed to the
// generator has no translated GLSL ([0x18]==0) at that moment (an ordering issue).
// NEXT: force w23 INSIDE the variant-select (a172c `mov w23,w3` -> `mov w23,#1`) to
// cover BOTH callers, AND if num_views still 0, add a runtime probe on the generator's
// silent return-0 paths (the guest generator can't be logged, so instrument via a
// klepton-side hook on glCreateShader/glShaderSource to see if a multiview source ever
// arrives). libtogl is per-title (portal's differs), so any force is fingerprint-safe.

// Force w23=1 INSIDE the variant-select (0xa1704), covering BOTH callers (a1a48 and
// a1eec) at once — the single-caller a1a48 force left num_views at 0, so the world
// shaders likely route through a1eec. If the generator now reaches glCompileShader
// (num_views appears) we learn whether ANGLE accepts the multiview GLSL; if it stays
// 0, the generator fails at a SILENT pre-build gate ([0x18]==0 GLSL-not-ready) and the
// fix is a timing/ordering one, not a force. Fingerprint-keyed (portal's a172c is

// ---- Half-Life: Alyx (Linux ARM64, depot 546564 build of 2026-09) -----------
//
// Source 2 hands LuaJIT its memory from below 2 GB. vscript's mmap override
// (lua_VALVE_OVERRIDE_MMAP) asks tier0's Plat_VirtualAlloc for a region with an
// upper address limit of 0x80000000; Plat_VirtualAlloc probes hint after hint in
// 64 KB steps, unmapping whatever the kernel returns above the limit, and
// vscript then checks the address once more itself. On Linux that finds a hole.
// On Darwin arm64 there is none to find: everything below 4 GB is __PAGEZERO,
// on a Mac and on a headset alike. So the probe fails after tens of thousands
// of mmap/munmap pairs and the engine dies with "Lua unable to create VM".
//
// The limit is policy, not need. This LuaJIT is a GC64 build — lua_gettop reads
// base and top at 0x20/0x28, the 64-bit GCRef layout — so it is correct for any
// address below 2^47, which is every address a Darwin process has. The two
// comparisons are therefore removed: Plat_VirtualAlloc takes the first mapping
// it is given, and vscript does not second-guess it.
//
// Taking the first mapping also ends the start-up storm: tier0's own static
// initialiser makes the same request for a 2 GB reserve, and used to burn
// ~390,000 syscalls discovering there was no room. Its caller still declines the

//
// In VR game mode the engine shrinks every 2D element that is not full-screen

//
//     scale = 0.25;  offset = (1 - scale) / 2;        // 0.375
//     x = x * scale + iWidth  * offset;   w *= scale;
//     y = y * scale + iHeight * offset;   h *= scale;
//
// There is no cvar for either number and `hud_scale` is forced every frame, so
// there is nothing to answer from outside. On a Vision Pro the result is a HUD
// that fills the middle of the view; reported as too large and too high.
//
// The function exists once and is inlined at three more places (SPR_DrawGeneric,
// CL_FillRGBA, CL_FillRGBABlend). Each copy loads the offset ONCE and uses it
// for both axes, so lowering the HUD needs a third constant, i.e. one more
// instruction than the copy has. The slot comes from the end of the block: it
// closes with a `b` over the `scvtf` that the other branch uses to convert the
// screen size, and converting the same integers a second time changes nothing —
// so the body moves down one word, the `b` goes, and control falls through.
